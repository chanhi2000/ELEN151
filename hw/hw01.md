.$$\text{Si}$$ crystallizes in diamond structure with a lattice constant of $$5.43\:\unicode{xC5}$$. For a $$\text{Si}\:(110)$$ wafer:

**(a)** Draw a sketch of the surface of the wafer displaying at least 20 atoms whose centers lie on this surface. You will need to consider multiple unit cells. Show a 2D-unit cell pertinent to a 3D unit cell.

**(b)** In the above sketch, label 4 distances of different magnitudes between any two atom **(i)** in terms of the lattice parameter $$a$$, and **(ii)** in $$\unicode{xC5}$$.

**(c)** Label using Miller indices four different directions obtained by joining any two atoms in the same sketch. Do not include opposit or parallel directions.

**(d)** Does the $$[101]$$ direction lies on this surface? Verify using dot products.

**(e)** Compute the 3D atomic density $$\left[\tfrac{\#}{\text{cm}^3}\right]$$ of $$\text{Si}$$ atoms on this surface. Show all calculations
