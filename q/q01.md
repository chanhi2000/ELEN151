**(b)** Show calculations to determine the Miller indicies for the plane drawn. Then express the plane in terms of its Miller indicies.


## 2.
**(a)** Express the direction shown in terms of its Miller indicies.

**(b)** Draw the $$[358]$$ direction in the coordinate system below showing its xyz components.
